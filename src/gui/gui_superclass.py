class GUISuperclass:
    """
    Abstract base class for creating interactive GUI controllers.

    This class provides a foundation for building interactive graphical user interfaces
    that control animations and visualizations. It defines the common structure and
    functionality that all GUI subclasses should implement, including play controls,
    parameter adjustments, and event handling.

    Attributes:
        animation_instance: Reference to the animation controller instance that
                           manages the simulation and visualization logic
        plot_manager: Reference to the plot manager instance that handles
                     figure creation and updating
        play_slider (widgets.IntSlider): Slider widget for manual frame navigation
        play (widgets.Play): Play/pause button widget for animation control

    def make_play_control_element(self, num_data_points) -> widgets:
        """
        Create the play control element with stop/restart/loop animation and frame slider.

        Constructs a linked play button and slider widget that allows users to:
        - Play/pause the animation
        - Manually navigate through frames using the slider
        - Control animation speed through the interval parameter
        - Loop through the animation sequence

        The play button and slider are JavaScript-linked so they stay synchronized,
        and both widgets are configured to trigger the on_value_change callback.

        Args:
            num_data_points (int): The total number of frames/data points in the animation.
                                 Determines the maximum value for the slider and play widget.

        Returns:
            widgets.HBox: A horizontal box containing the play button and slider widgets,
                         ready for placement in the GUI layout.
